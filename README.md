## Meet Marijn Meijles (User Scenario)
![The man himself](./course/marijn-meijles.jpg)

This application is made specifically for Marijn Meijles, Marijn is a developer who loves metal music with a motoric disorder which weakens his muscles. As you can imagine this could make certain things difficult for Marijn. To be more specific, things that require accuracy/precision in movements can be challenging.

It's the start of the week and Marijn has to go to Amsterdam as usual for work. As he lives pretty for away from Amsterdam (Eindhoven) he's gonna want to book a night stay in a hotel.

Marijn opens the application and right away gets instructions on how to start. Cause Marijn has used the application before there are already some defaults he can pick, he picks his usual hotel/room-type and continues. Next up Marijn picks the day he wants to check-in for. Cause the application knows that Marijn normally stays 1 night it suggest the very next day to be the check-out date. Perfect!

All the details get filled in an overview which already had some exclusive presets for Marijn.

## Exclusive design principles
Here we will be looking at the principles of exclusive design.

### Study situation
The first step we took as a group was to do research about Marijn before asking him any questions we had to be prepared. By browsing repositories from last year we were able to find a bunch of information, like:

- Marijn is a father, software engineer and a huge metal lover!
- Likes to joke around a lot and has no trouble speaking his mind
- Uses 1 hand (left) to use keyboard/trackpad
- He prefers to use keys which are close to eachother e.g. arrow keys
- Barely uses tab
